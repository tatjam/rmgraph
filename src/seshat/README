License: Seshat is released under the license GPLv3 (see LICENSE file)

----------------
Requirements:
- Compilation tools: makefile and g++
- Xerces-c library for parsing XML.
- Boost libraries for RNNLIB (must be in include path or it should be added 
in the FLAGS variable of Makefile file).

----------------
Usage: ./seshat -c config -i input [-o output] [-r render.pgm]

  -c config: set the configuration file
  -i input:  set the input math expression file
  -o output: save recognized expression to 'output' file (InkML format)
  -r render: save in 'render' the image representing the input expression (PGM format)
  -d graph:  save in 'graph' the description of the recognized tree (DOT format)

----------------
Example:
There are two example math expressions in folder "SampleMathExps". The following command
will recognize the expression (x+y)^2 encoded in "exp.scgink"

$ ./seshat -c Config/CONFIG -i SampleMathExps/exp.scgink -o out.inkml -r render.pgm -d out.dot

This command outputs several information through the standard output, where the last line will
provide the LaTeX string of the recognized math expression.

An image representation of the input strokes will be rendered in "render.pgm".

The InkML file of the recognized math expression will be saved in "out.inkml".

The derivation tree of the expression provided as a graph in DOT format will be saved in "out.dot".
The representation of the graph in, for example, postscript format can be obtained as follows

$ dot -o out.ps out.dot -Tps

It should be noted that only options "-c" and "-i" are mandatory.
